# Hangman with JavaScript

## MVP

- - A game should start with a word being randomly selected.
- A representation of the word made up of underscore (\_) characters should display on the screen.
- Create a user interface made up of buttons representing all 26 letters of the alphabet.
- Clicking a button should register its letter as a 'guess'
- If the letter clicked is in the word each underscore corresponding to that letter should be replaced with the letter.
- If the letter is not in the word, an additional element to the hangman diagram should be added.
- The game should keep track of which letters have been 'guessed' already.
- The game should provide a win or loss message depending on the outcome
- There should be some functionality to play again.
- This should be styled to support mobile, tablet, and desktop views

## Extras

- Allow keyboard input
- Keep track of words that have been used already and display them on the screen
